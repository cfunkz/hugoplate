I've always been enthusiastic about tech and IT, experimenting with servers, systems and web deployment to better understand how stuff works. That curiosity have evolved, and since 2022 I've been fully committed to build my skills in IT field. As of lately, I've been leaning into the world of system automation, containers, docker and most frequently Type 1 Hypervisor Proxmox with the aim to master system replication and networking.
